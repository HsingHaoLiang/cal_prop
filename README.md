test.txt is the input file for ML models, the first index is compound and it needs to be float or integer, 2 to 325 are sigma profile of compound, 326 to 336 are reduced temperature, 337 to 347 are reduced pressure at certain reduced temperature(326 to 336) predicted by PR+COSMOSAC EOS, 348 is the reduced temperature what you want to predict, 349 is reduced pressure at reduced temperature(348) predicted by PR+COSMOSAC EOS, 350 to 352 are the boiling temperature, critical temperature and critical pressure respectively predicted by PR+COSMOSAC EOS and 353 to 356 are experimental values of boiling temperature, critical temperature and critical pressure respectively. Experimental value is not nesscessary. You can replace it with any arbitrary values.
In the test.txt, 16703 is water and 16131 is ethanol
Before you run this programm you need to download keras, tensorflow, pandas and SeqSelfAttention
